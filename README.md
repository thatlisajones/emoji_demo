# EmojiDiary

What are you feeling? Emoji Diary can help you verbalize it. Select emoji that represent your mood. The app will give you words that match. If you like, you can log in and create a diary of your feelings. You can save daily "emotional snapshots" along with your comments.

We created a custom API drawn from the "Feeling Wheel", a tool used by counsellors and therapists to help clients get in touch with their feelings. We connected each word on the wheel with emoji.

Pick three emoji. Get vocabulary. Use your words.

This is a project of the University of Denver Women's Coding Boot Camp, 2018-2019.
